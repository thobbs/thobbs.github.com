Earlier this year I began creating programmatic artwork using [matplotlib] [1].
I was interested in making art using the most powerful tool I knew of: code.

So far the results have been better than I ever expected.  All sorts
of wild ideas and experiments are possible. The medium could easily
supply challenges for centuries.

I've recently switched from matplotlib to [Processing] [2].  Matplotlib
was simply not designed to generate images at the sizes I need.  Processing
handles the work naturally.  It also has capabilities for 3D and animation,
both of which I would like to explore at some point.

I've also started using [Quil] [3], a Clojure wrapper for Processing (which
is Java).  Lisps lend themselves very well to the kinds of crazy code
that generative artwork can require.

Finally, I've created a website to [display my artwork and a few writings on algorithmic artwork] [4].
If you're interested in the work I've shown here, I hope you'll check it out.
